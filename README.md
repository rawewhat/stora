## Install

using npm  
`npm i @rawewhat/stora`

using yarn  
`yarn add @rawewhat/stora`

## Setup

### 1. Initialize states and actions in stora.config.js

create a stora config file in either root or src directory of your project.

Example:  
/stora.config.js  
/src/stora.config.js

```javascript
export default {
  // This will be where you initialize your states
  states: {
    testScreen: {
      testState: 'testState'
    },
    demoScreen: {
      demoState: 'demoState'
    }
  },
  // This will be where you initialize your actions
  actions: {
    testScreen: {
      testAction: stora => {
        console.log('stora', stora)
      }
    },
    demoScreen: {
      demoAction: ({ states, actions }) => {
        console.log('states', states, 'actions', actions)
      }
    }
  },
  // If you need to do something before global state initialization
  init: stora => {
    console.log('stora', stora)
  }
}
```

_Note: states and actions object uses screen based naming convention_

### 2. Initialize states and actions in top-level component

if you don't want to use stora.config.js to initialize your states and actions, use below syntax instead

Example: change your **App.js** like below

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import useStora from '@rawewhat/stora'
// you can also import it from another place such as your config directory
import { STATES, ACTIONS, INIT } from '../config'

const STATES = {
  testScreen: {
    testState: 'testState'
  },
  demoScreen: {
    demoState: 'demoState'
  }
}

const ACTIONS = {
  testScreen: {
    testAction: stora => {
      console.log('stora', stora)
    }
  },
  demoScreen: {
    demoAction: ({ states, actions }) => {
      console.log('states', states, 'actions', actions)
    }
  }
}

const INIT = stora => {
  console.log('stora', stora)
}

const App = props => {
  const [states, actions] = useStora(STATES, ACTIONS, INIT)
  console.log('states', states, 'actions', actions)
  return <div>App</div>
}

export default App
```

_Note: states and actions object uses screen based naming convention_

## Usage

### 1. Change state inside action function

in your action function you have access to the global store where you can change and access state.

#### 1.1 Change a screen state using key value pair

change only one screen states using key and value argument

```javascript
const EXAMPLE_ACTIONS = {
  exampleScreen: {
    exampleAction: ({ set }) => {
      set('testScreen', {
        testState: 'changed'
      })
    }
  }
}
```
*Any other states in testScreen will be added automatically*

#### 1.2 Change multiple screen states using object

change multiple screen states using new screen states object and automatically adding other screen states

```javascript
const EXAMPLE_ACTIONS = {
  exampleScreen: {
    exampleAction: ({ set }) => {
      set({
        testScreen: {
          testState: 'changed'
        },
        demoScreen: {
          demoState: 'changed'
        }
      })
    }
  }
}
```
*Any other screen states will be added automatically*

#### 1.3 Change multiple screen states using arrays

change multiple screen states using arrays of new screen states object and automatically adding other screen states

```javascript
const EXAMPLE_ACTIONS = {
  exampleScreen: {
    exampleAction: ({ set }) => {
      set([
        {
          testScreen: {
            testState: 'changed'
          }
        },
        {
          demoScreen: {
            demoState: null
          }
        }
      ])
    }
  }
}
```
*Any other screen states will be added automatically*

#### 1.4 Get a screen states using screen name

get only one screen states using string of screen name

```javascript
const EXAMPLE_ACTIONS = {
  exampleScreen: {
    exampleAction: ({ get }) => {
      const testScreen = get('testScreen')
    }
  }
}
```

#### 1.5 Get multiple screen states using arrays of screen name key

get multiple screen states using arrays of screen name string

```javascript
const EXAMPLE_ACTIONS = {
  exampleScreen: {
    exampleAction: ({ get }) => {
      const {
        testScreen: { testState },
        demoScreen: { demoState }
      } = get(['testScreen', 'demoScreen'])
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Access states and actions

#### 2.1 Get one or multiple screen states

you can access states of specific screen or even multiple screen states using destructuring syntax.

```javascript
const [
  {
    testScreen: { testState },
    demoScreen: { demoState }
  },
  actions
] = useStora()
```

#### 2.2 Get one or multiple screen actions

you may access actions of specific screen or even multiple screen actions using destructuring syntax.

```javascript
const [
  states,
  {
    testScreen: { testAction },
    demoScreen: { demoAction }
  }
] = useStora()
```

#### 2.3 Get only actions and skip states

you can also skip states object and directly access actions using below syntax.

```javascript
const [, actions] = useStora()
```

#### 2.4 Get states and actions with dot

you may also use dot access on states and actions too

```javascript
const [states, actions] = useStora()

console.log('testState:', states.testScreen.testState)
actions.demoScreen.demoAction()
```

### 3. Adding additional states or actions

sometimes you want add more states when using useStora hook on a screen

- **mutate** for adding additional states and actions.

Example: adding another screen states

```javascript
const [
  {
    newScreen: { newState },
    testScreen: { testState },
    demoScreen: { demoState }
  },
  actions
] = useStora({
  mutate: {
    newScreen: {
      newState: 'newState'
    }
  }
})
```

Example: adding another screen actions

```javascript
const [
  ,
  {
    newScreen: { newActions },
    testScreen: { testAction },
    demoScreen: { demoAction }
  }
] = useStora({
  mutate: {
    newScreen: {
      newAction: stora => {
        console.log('stora', stora)
      }
    }
  }
})
```

_by checking mutation object type, useStora is smart enough to know whether you want to add state or action_

### 4. Selecting one or multiple states

if you want to return only some screen states from useStora hook

- **query** for selecting specific screen states

Example: select only one screen states

```javascript
const [states, actions] = useStora({
  query: 'testScreen'
})
// states for this component contains only testScreen states
const {
  testScreen: { testState }
} = states
```

Example: select multiple screen states

```javascript
const [states, actions] = useStora({
  query: ['testScreen', 'demoScreen']
})
// states for this component contains only testScreen and demoScreen states
const {
  testScreen: { testState },
  demoScreen: { demoState }
} = states
```

## Example

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import useStora from '@rawewhat/stora'

const App = () => {
  const [, actions] = useStora()
  useEffect(() => {
    actions.testing()
  }, [])
  return (
    <div>
      StoRa Demo
      <Test />
    </div>
  )
}

const Test = () => {
  const [states, actions] = useStora({
    mutate: {
      love: () => {}
    }
  })
  console.log('states', states, 'actions', actions)
  return (
    <div>
      Test
      <Test2 />
    </div>
  )
}

const Test2 = () => {
  const [states, actions] = useStora({
    mutate: {
      test100: {
        test111: 'test111'
      }
    },
    query: ['test100']
  })
  console.log('states', states, 'actions', actions)
  return <div>Test2</div>
}

export default App
```
